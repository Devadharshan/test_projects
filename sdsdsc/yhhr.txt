Project Summary – Automated File & Folder Archival for Space Cleanup

We have a requirement to clear space across multiple Windows shared drives and directories.
Large volumes of log files, CSVs, and dated application output folders accumulate over time, consuming storage and impacting performance.

To address this, we implemented an automated archival and cleanup solution that runs through an Autosys scheduled job, which calls a Python archival script.
This script intelligently identifies old data, archives it, and removes it based on rules defined in a configuration file.

Solution Overview

The solution consists of:
	1.	Autosys Job
	•	Runs on a schedule (daily / weekly as needed)
	•	Executes the Python archival script automatically
	•	Provides logging and monitoring support
	2.	Python Archival Script
	•	Reads a JSON configuration describing:
	•	Multiple directories to process
	•	Retention days
	•	File extensions to include
	•	Whether to archive individual files or entire dated folders
	•	ZIP retention period (when archived ZIPs should be deleted)
	•	Traverses subfolders recursively
	•	Archives eligible data into ZIP files
	•	Deletes original files/folders after archiving
	•	Removes old ZIP files based on cleanup policy
	•	Logs all actions to a centralized log directory
	3.	Configurable JSON File
	•	Supports multiple locations
	•	Allows custom rules per directory
	•	Ensures no executable files (exe/dll/zip) are re-zipped
	•	Prevents accidental archiving of system or active data
