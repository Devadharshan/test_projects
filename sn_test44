To get ticket counts based on the current month, current day, and last month, you'll need to adjust your SQL queries accordingly. Here’s how you can modify your queries to achieve that:
1. Querying for Ticket Counts

You can create three separate SQL queries: one for the current month, one for the current day, and one for the last month.
Current Month

sql

SELECT COUNT(*) AS ticket_count
FROM your_view
WHERE assignment_group_id = 'YOUR_ASSIGNMENT_GROUP_ID'
AND MONTH(created_on) = MONTH(GETDATE())
AND YEAR(created_on) = YEAR(GETDATE())

Current Day

sql

SELECT COUNT(*) AS ticket_count
FROM your_view
WHERE assignment_group_id = 'YOUR_ASSIGNMENT_GROUP_ID'
AND CAST(created_on AS DATE) = CAST(GETDATE() AS DATE)

Last Month

sql

SELECT COUNT(*) AS ticket_count
FROM your_view
WHERE assignment_group_id = 'YOUR_ASSIGNMENT_GROUP_ID'
AND MONTH(created_on) = MONTH(DATEADD(MONTH, -1, GETDATE()))
AND YEAR(created_on) = YEAR(DATEADD(MONTH, -1, GETDATE()))

2. Python Code Example

Here’s how you can implement this in Python:

python

import pyodbc

# Set up the database connection
conn = pyodbc.connect('DRIVER={SQL Server};'
                      'SERVER=your_server;'
                      'DATABASE=your_database;'
                      'UID=your_username;'
                      'PWD=your_password;')

assignment_group = 'YOUR_ASSIGNMENT_GROUP_ID'

# Define queries
queries = {
    "current_month": f"""
        SELECT COUNT(*) AS ticket_count 
        FROM your_view 
        WHERE assignment_group_id = '{assignment_group}' 
        AND MONTH(created_on) = MONTH(GETDATE()) 
        AND YEAR(created_on) = YEAR(GETDATE())
    """,
    "current_day": f"""
        SELECT COUNT(*) AS ticket_count 
        FROM your_view 
        WHERE assignment_group_id = '{assignment_group}' 
        AND CAST(created_on AS DATE) = CAST(GETDATE() AS DATE)
    """,
    "last_month": f"""
        SELECT COUNT(*) AS ticket_count 
        FROM your_view 
        WHERE assignment_group_id = '{assignment_group}' 
        AND MONTH(created_on) = MONTH(DATEADD(MONTH, -1, GETDATE())) 
        AND YEAR(created_on) = YEAR(DATEADD(MONTH, -1, GETDATE()))
    """
}

# Execute queries and store results
ticket_counts = {}

cursor = conn.cursor()
for key, query in queries.items():
    cursor.execute(query)
    result = cursor.fetchone()
    ticket_counts[key] = result.ticket_count if result else 0

# Close the cursor and connection
cursor.close()
conn.close()

# Print the ticket counts
print(f"Ticket counts: {ticket_counts}")

3. Sending Data to Grafana

You can push these counts to Grafana using the Pushgateway. Here's how you might structure that:

python

from prometheus_client import CollectorRegistry, Gauge, push_to_gateway

# Define the Pushgateway address
pushgateway = 'http://your_pushgateway:9091'

# Create a registry and Gauge metrics
registry = CollectorRegistry()
current_month_gauge = Gauge('ticket_count_current_month', 'Number of tickets for current month', registry=registry)
current_day_gauge = Gauge('ticket_count_current_day', 'Number of tickets for current day', registry=registry)
last_month_gauge = Gauge('ticket_count_last_month', 'Number of tickets for last month', registry=registry)

# Set the ticket counts
current_month_gauge.set(ticket_counts['current_month'])
current_day_gauge.set(ticket_counts['current_day'])
last_month_gauge.set(ticket_counts['last_month'])

# Push the data to the Pushgateway
try:
    push_to_gateway(pushgateway, job='service_now_tickets', registry=registry)
    print("Data pushed to Pushgateway successfully!")
except Exception as e:
    print(f'Failed to push data: {e}')

Summary

This setup will allow you to count tickets based on the current month, current day, and last month, and push those counts to Grafana for visualization. Make sure to adjust the column names (created_on, assignment_group_id) and the view name to match your database schema.

To visualize your ticket counts in Grafana as a time series with dates on the X-axis and counts on the Y-axis, you’ll need to adjust your approach slightly when sending the data to the Prometheus Pushgateway. Here’s how you can do it:
1. Modify Data Structure

Instead of just sending counts for current month, current day, and last month, you should send time series data with timestamps. This way, Grafana can plot the counts against time.
2. Querying Data

You will need to adjust your SQL queries to aggregate ticket counts over time (daily or monthly). Here’s how you can do that:
Daily Counts for Current Month

sql

SELECT CAST(created_on AS DATE) AS date, COUNT(*) AS ticket_count
FROM your_view
WHERE assignment_group_id = 'YOUR_ASSIGNMENT_GROUP_ID'
AND MONTH(created_on) = MONTH(GETDATE())
AND YEAR(created_on) = YEAR(GETDATE())
GROUP BY CAST(created_on AS DATE)
ORDER BY date

Monthly Counts for Last 6 Months (or any range)

sql

SELECT DATEADD(MONTH, DATEDIFF(MONTH, 0, created_on), 0) AS month, COUNT(*) AS ticket_count
FROM your_view
WHERE assignment_group_id = 'YOUR_ASSIGNMENT_GROUP_ID'
AND created_on >= DATEADD(MONTH, -6, GETDATE())
GROUP BY DATEADD(MONTH, DATEDIFF(MONTH, 0, created_on), 0)
ORDER BY month

3. Python Code to Push Data to Pushgateway

Here’s how to modify your Python code to push time series data to the Pushgateway:

python

import pyodbc
from prometheus_client import CollectorRegistry, Gauge, push_to_gateway
from datetime import datetime

# Set up the database connection
conn = pyodbc.connect('DRIVER={SQL Server};'
                      'SERVER=your_server;'
                      'DATABASE=your_database;'
                      'UID=your_username;'
                      'PWD=your_password;')

assignment_group = 'YOUR_ASSIGNMENT_GROUP_ID'

# Daily counts for current month
query_daily_current_month = f"""
    SELECT CAST(created_on AS DATE) AS date, COUNT(*) AS ticket_count
    FROM your_view
    WHERE assignment_group_id = '{assignment_group}' 
    AND MONTH(created_on) = MONTH(GETDATE()) 
    AND YEAR(created_on) = YEAR(GETDATE())
    GROUP BY CAST(created_on AS DATE)
    ORDER BY date
"""

# Monthly counts for last 6 months
query_monthly_last_6_months = f"""
    SELECT DATEADD(MONTH, DATEDIFF(MONTH, 0, created_on), 0) AS month, COUNT(*) AS ticket_count
    FROM your_view
    WHERE assignment_group_id = '{assignment_group}' 
    AND created_on >= DATEADD(MONTH, -6, GETDATE())
    GROUP BY DATEADD(MONTH, DATEDIFF(MONTH, 0, created_on), 0)
    ORDER BY month
"""

# Execute queries and push data
registry = CollectorRegistry()

# Daily counts
cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute(query_daily_current_month)
for row in cursor.fetchall():
    date = row.date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')  # Format date
    count = row.ticket_count
    gauge = Gauge('ticket_count_daily', 'Number of tickets per day', ['date'], registry=registry)
    gauge.labels(date=date).set(count)

# Monthly counts
cursor.execute(query_monthly_last_6_months)
for row in cursor.fetchall():
    month = row.month.strftime('%Y-%m')  # Format month
    count = row.ticket_count
    gauge = Gauge('ticket_count_monthly', 'Number of tickets per month', ['month'], registry=registry)
    gauge.labels(month=month).set(count)

# Push data to Pushgateway
try:
    push_to_gateway('http://your_pushgateway:9091', job='service_now_tickets', registry=registry)
    print("Data pushed to Pushgateway successfully!")
except Exception as e:
    print(f'Failed to push data: {e}')

# Close the cursor and connection
cursor.close()
conn.close()

4. Setting Up Grafana

    Add Prometheus as a Data Source: Ensure that Prometheus is configured as a data source in Grafana.

    Create a Dashboard: Start a new dashboard and add a new panel.

    Configure the Query:
        For daily counts, use the query:

        bash

ticket_count_daily{date=~".*"}

For monthly counts, use:

sql

        ticket_count_monthly{month=~".*"}

    Choose Visualization Type: Select the "Time series" visualization.

    Set X-Axis and Y-Axis:
        X-Axis: Choose “Time series” for time-based data.
        Y-Axis: Set to display the count.

    Customize Panel: Adjust titles, legends, and styles as needed.

Summary

This setup will allow you to visualize the ticket counts as a time series in Grafana, with dates or months on the X-axis and counts on the Y-axis. Adjust your SQL queries and ensure your Prometheus setup is correct to get everything working smoothly!
